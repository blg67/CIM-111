          <h3>Treatments with oils</h3>
          <p>Using oils for as remidies helps decrease the amount of OTC medication intake, which that leads to imporving your liver becuase Advil and Ibprofen products affect the liver and the more you take the more damage is done. Another thing is that the oils take about 2-5 seconds to reach into your blood system so it ahs an even faster resolution time then Advil or Ibprofen. This is a chemical free, vegan living, natural life style that is fun to do. There are so many things you can do with these oils besides using it as remidies. </p>
